<p>Heya dear readers! Hope you all are doing fine ;-) Well most of you know me but for those who don’t, I am a simple little human being with some really simple aspirations of living a happy life, travelling new places and eating lots  of different kinds of food. I love reading books, playing badminton and programming of course (●’◡’●).</p>

<p>I am currently fulfilling my knack for programming and open source and let me tell you this is really AweSOME.</p>

<p>You can find me on ✨</p>
