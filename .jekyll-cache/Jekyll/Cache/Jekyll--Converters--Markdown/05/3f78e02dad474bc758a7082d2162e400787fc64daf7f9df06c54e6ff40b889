I"<p>Well this was my first experience of working with a huge project for GSoC 2021.
To be honest I was really late for making contributions to the project as I was waiting for the results of Outreachy but a huge thanks to the developer community of Debian for being very supportive throughout the process.</p>

<p>Also, to my surprise there were just a few student developers working on the project(just 3 at that time) and this saved me from being overwhelmed and I could carry out my work with ease.</p>

<p>I am quite familiar with git and Github, HTML, C++ and this was the main reason for me choosing this project.
I was able to setup the project <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci">Debian Continuous Integerations</a> (debci)  within two days.</p>

<p>When I began contributing to the project, I got to know that most of the codes were written in Ruby and Shell. Well this was quite a learning curve for me, I got to fix some of the shellcheck errors and errors in the ruby files.</p>

<p>I attended the meeting for GSoC, got a chance to interact with the mentors and was able to clarify my doubts.
As of now the contribution and proposal submission preiod is over.
I am still looking forward to contribute to Debian irrespective of the the outcome of GSoC.</p>

<p>You can view my project proposal <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPS0DD3us0_5ecczn9-vZxP8ujcYpJGTsJPomL5X75k/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll keep you all updated about the status of my application.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Happy Coding ;-)</p>
