<h2 id="application-process">Application process</h2>

<p>The initial application consists of submitting a resume, answering 5-6 essay type questions (the word limit ranges from 200-250 words) and a letter of recommendation from your college professor.</p>

<p>Talking about the application process, there are 5 parts to the application.</p>

<h3 id="1-basic-information">1. Basic Information</h3>

<p>This part includes filling up basic details about your course, university, CGPA, contact information and research areas of interest. (If there’s any tip I could share for this section, I would recommend reading up about the advancements in the research areas you’ve mentioned to gather more than just the surface-level knowledge.) The research areas I had mentioned were Machine Learning, BCI, and Robotics.</p>

<h3 id="2-essays">2. Essays</h3>

<p>There were 5 essay-based questions, all of which you were expected to write in under 200 words. These essays intend to understand your personality, why you’re interested in the field of technology, your goals, the difficulties you’ve faced as a woman in technology, your role model and of course why you think you deserve this scholarship.</p>

<p>While writing these answers, don’t hesitate to mention your achievements or failures, but make sure, to be honest. Craft a story that can describe who you are, your interests and passion, and do not try to answer it superficially. Your answers shall speak more about you rather that</p>

<h3 id="3-resume">3. Resume</h3>

<p>My resume had a combination of my important academic grades, work experience (internships), projects, achievements, positions of responsibility &amp; certifications. My resume was actually 2 pages long, which isn’t recommended usually. But, I had applied with an ‘I am not going to clear it anyway, so why stick to the rules?’ attitude. Well, I guess it helped somehow.</p>

<p>Again, make sure to be honest, in your resume about your achievements &amp; projects, because both my interviews were based on the things I had listed in my resume.</p>

<h3 id="4-academic-transcripts">4. Academic Transcripts</h3>

<p>I had included my semester grade cards (the first three semesters whose results were published) &amp; my 12th and 10th certificates.</p>

<h3 id="5-letter-of-recommendation">5. Letter of Recommendation</h3>

<p>Approach a professor from college who knows you personally and request for a letter of recommendation. Try and request in advance, because chances are, your professor could be giving recommendations for a lot of people from your institution as well. (I had found later that my staff advisor had to give the recommendation letter to more than 10 people!) So, ensure that, you give the professor sufficient buffer time to submit the letter by the deadline.</p>

<h3 id="6-multimedia">6. Multimedia</h3>

<p>There’s also an additional multimedia (video) submission link. But it’s completely up to you to decide whether to submit one or not. I had decided against it.</p>
