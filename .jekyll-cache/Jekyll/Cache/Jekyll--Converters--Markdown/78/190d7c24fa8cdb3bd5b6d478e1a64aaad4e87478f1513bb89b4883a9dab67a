<p>Students may be invited for phone interviews for internship opportunities prior to Fellowship winner selection.</p>

<h2 id="application-process">Application process</h2>

<p>The initial application consists of submitting a resume, answering 5-6 essay type questions (the word limit ranges from 200-250 words) and a letter of recommendation from your college professor.</p>

<p>Talking about the application process, there are 5 parts to the application.</p>

<h3 id="1-basic-information">1. Basic Information</h3>

<p>This part includes filling up basic details about your course, university, CGPA, contact information and research areas of interest. (If thereâ€™s any tip I could share for this section, I would recommend reading up about the advancements in the research areas youâ€™ve mentioned to gather more than just the surface-level knowledge.) The research areas I had mentioned were Machine Learning, BCI, and Robotics.</p>

<h3 id="2-essays">2. Essays</h3>

<p>There were 5 essay-based questions, all of which you were expected to write in under 200 words. These essays intend to understand your personality, why youâ€™re interested in the field of technology, your goals, the difficulties youâ€™ve faced as a woman in technology, your role model and of course why you think you deserve this scholarship.</p>

<p>While writing these answers, donâ€™t hesitate to mention your achievements or failures, but make sure, to be honest. Craft a story that can describe who you are, your interests and passion, and do not try to answer it superficially. Your answers shall speak more about what you are now rather that what you want to become or achieve.</p>

<h3 id="3-resume">3. Resume</h3>

<p>My resume had a combination of my important academic grades, work experience (internships), projects, achievements, positions of responsibility &amp; certifications. Here is a tip - Try to keep your resume short and limit it to a single page. Choose the projects carefully because this is where most of your discussions shall be focused on. Also, make sure that you mention those projects that have a significant impact and deal with reallife scenarios.</p>

<p>Again, make sure to be honest, in your resume about your achievements &amp; projects, because both my interviews were based on the things I had listed in my resume.</p>

<h3 id="4-academic-transcripts">4. Academic Transcripts</h3>

<p>I had included my semester grade cards (the first three semesters whose results were published) &amp; my 12th and 10th certificates.</p>

<h3 id="5-letter-of-recommendation">5. Letter of Recommendation</h3>

<p>Approach a professor from college who knows you personally(and can write a good LOR - Yes it does help in strengthening your application) and request for a letter of recommendation. Try and request in advance, because chances are, your professor could be giving recommendations for a lot of people from your institution as well. So, ensure that, you give the professor sufficient buffer time to submit the letter by the deadline.</p>

<h3 id="6-multimedia">6. Multimedia</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s also an additional multimedia (video) submission link. But itâ€™s completely up to you to decide whether to submit one or not. I decided to submit one.

<h1 id="the-dream-e-mail">The Dream E-Mail</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Adobe-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To be honest, I literally applied to for the scholarship with <strong>I am not going to make it but there is no harm in trying</strong> kind of attitude and on that day when I saw this email, I could not believe my eyes. I was quite excited and nervous about the interview.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was I woke my mom and told her about the email. She was so happy that she hugged me! :-)</p>

<p>Next thing that I did was to reply to the e-mail to schedule the interview. Since I got a lot of days to choose from, I chose 23 November for my interview. Next I began preparing for the interview. I saw a lot of videos of previous scholars and started reiterating on my essays and projects.</p>

<p>Â </p>
