I"Ã<p>Heya dear readers! Hope you all are doing fine ;-) Well most of you know me but for those who don‚Äôt, I am a simple little human being with some really simple aspirations of living a happy life, travelling new places and eating lots  of different kinds of food. I love reading books, playing badminton and programming of course (‚óè‚Äô‚ó°‚Äô‚óè).</p>

<p>I am currently fulfilling my knack for programming and open source and let me tell you this is really AweSOME.</p>

<p>You can find me on ‚ú®</p>
