This project titled **The Conurbation Algorithm** is aimed at developing a fully functional featured city without disrupting the ecological density of the city. It was the winning project of my first hackathon **Electrothon 2k20** at NIT Hamirpur. It is a further modification of the initial [city generation model](https://github.com/josauder/procedural_city_generation).


In this blog I shall give a brief overview of the workflow of this project. I am **not** going **to touch the coding part** as of now so as to prevent the things from being more complicated to comprehend.

### Challenges :
- Migrating the the code from PyQt4 to PyQt5 and updating the code with the new dependencies.
- Automating the Blender Scripts to run directly from the PyQt5 GUI.
- Cleaning the code to remove all the version conflicts.
- Generating the new map to run the test scripts.
- Updating and modifying the codes for growth rules.

### Input -
The input to the conurbation algorithm is the map generated from the project [Land Stratification](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/Land-Stratification-ISRO/blob/master/README.md).

The growth rule image defines the formation of road network of the town that is created. 

Well we need a road network to traverse across the town, isn't it? 

Blue color implies a radial growth rule(roads originate from a single junction), red colour indicates grid growth rule(like we have in properly planned cities-proper block division) and green colour depicts organic(random) growth rule.

### Steps to replicate the Program
- Clone this repository
- Change all the paths in the files [GUI.py](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Conurbation-Algorithm/blob/master/src/GUI.py) and [blenderize.py](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Conurbation-Algorithm/blob/master/src/procedural_city_generation/visualization/blenderize.py).
- Remove all the __pycache__ files from the cloned folder if present.
- Check all the installed dependencies.
- Install and add blender to the environment path.
- Run the script [GUI.py](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Conurbation-Algorithm/blob/master/src/GUI.py).


*If everything worked so far, the PyQt5 window should openup and the algorithm should generate the city with the clicks.Make sure to run all the tabs in order,i.e., Roadmap Generation-> Polygon Extraction -> Building Generation ->Visualise in Blender.*

Feel free to experiment with [growth rule images](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Conurbation-Algorithm/tree/master/src/procedural_city_generation/inputs/rule_pictures) and [Density images](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Conurbation-Algorithm/tree/master/src/procedural_city_generation/inputs/density_pictures) and open a pull request for further modification of the project.
